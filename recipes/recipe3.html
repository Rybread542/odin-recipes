                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup(2 sticks/226g) <strong>unsalted butter</strong></li>
                        <li>1 cup (200g) packed light or dark <strong>brown sugar</strong></li>
                        <li>1/2 cup (100g) <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
                        <li>2 large<strong>eggs</strong>, at room temperature</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons<strong>pure vanilla extract</strong></li>
                        <li>2 1/2 cups (313g) <strong>all-purpose flour</strong></li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon <strong>baking soda</strong></li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
                        <li>1 cup (150g) <strong>Heath Bar Toffee, or homemade toffee bits</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Brown the butter:</strong> Set out a medium heat-proof bowl because you’ll need it at the end of this step. 
                        Slice the butter into Tablespoon-size pieces and place in a light-colored skillet or large pot. Light colored helps 
                        you determine when the butter begins browning. (See note if using a dark skillet or pot.) Melt the butter over medium 
                        heat and stir or whisk constantly. Once melted, the butter will begin to foam. Keep stirring/whisking. After 5-7 minutes, 
                        the butter will begin browning and you’ll notice lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan. It will 
                        have a nutty aroma. Once browned, remove from heat immediately and pour into the bowl, including any solids that have 
                        formed on the bottom of the pan. (You want those solids for flavor.) Cool brown butter for 5 minutes. Don’t cool longer 
                        than that because the butter will begin to thicken and, as a result, the cookie dough will be difficult to mix and its 
                        texture will be too crumbly.</li>

                    <li>Whisk the brown sugar and granulated sugar into the brown butter and then whisk in the eggs and vanilla extract. Set aside. 
                        In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the 
                        chocolate chips and toffee, then stir together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will seem too dry at first, 
                        but keeping stirring until it comes together. Dough will be greasy, thick, and a bit crumbly.</li>

                    <li>Scoop dough into balls, about 1 and 1/2 Tablespoons of dough each, and place on a large plate or baking sheet. I like to roll 
                        each cookie dough ball between my hands to smooth them out since they can be a little crumbly. Cover and chill the cookie dough 
                        balls in the refrigerator for 2 hours and up to 3 days before baking. </li>

                    <li>Towards the end of chill time, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>

                    <li>Arrange cookie dough balls 3 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. If desired, lightly sprinkle coarse sea salt on top of each. Press the 
                        salt down into the cookie dough balls if it’s not sticking.</li>

                    <li>Bake for 12-13 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before 
                        transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. While the cookies are still warm, I like to press a few more chocolate chips or toffee pieces into the 
                        tops– this is only for looks! Cookies are extra soft out of the oven, but become chewier as they cool.</li>

                    <li>Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the refrigerator for 1 week.</li>
